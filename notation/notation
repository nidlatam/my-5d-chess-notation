ok what would you need in a notation
1. a way of showing coordinates:
    xy|t||l|
    x is the horizantal
    y is vertical
    t is time. It starts at 1
    l is timeline. The first one is 0. If there is more than one starting it is addressed in line 11.
    # if it blacked out or whited out. If the number is negative it is blacked out and if positive it will be whited out
    if there are two starting boards
    +0 and -0
    so it could be 
    A1|10||#2| would be 
    physical coordinate A1
    the time would be 10
    the timeline would be timeline 2 and it would be whited out 

    also one note
    if there is a new timeline the first board on it will not be 1. That would just make it more confusing.
    If you want to get the coordinate of the first board of a new timeline here is a tip.
    just get the time coordinate of where you are moving to and yeah like that you get it.
    
    I did want to show if the board is white or black but we already know that from the piece that moves.
2. a way of showing the thing that is moving plus the color:
    + or - for white and black
    letters for the pieces 
    P for a pawn
    R for a rook
    B for a bishop
    N for a knight
    K for a king
    Q for a queen
    U for an unicorn
    D for a dragon
    so +D would be white dragon for example
3. a way of showing movement:
    lets use some arrows
    -->
    if it time travels and creates a new dimension
    we put inside the -s the coordinate
    so
    -10->
    and if it blacked or whited out (you can tell with the color of the piece moving)
    -#10->
    ok that's the arrow done

    before the second coordinate
    if there is a piece taken 
    we show that piece with the opposite color
    
    oh and I forgot
    check, checkmate
    I am gonna have check be represented here
    but checkmate and stalemate after all the movements
    in the start if it makes a check do / in the start and end

    now to combine this all lets give an example

    /+D a1|20||0| -#2-> -B a2|19||1|/
4. a way of showing multiple moves:
    1=>1 (movement 1)
    2=>2 (movement 2)
    3=>3 (movement 3)
5. a way of showing moves between timelines that do not cause another timeline
    imagine there are timelines 1, 2 and 3
    (they are ordered from top timeline coordinate to the bottem)
    1=>3 (movement 1)
    2=>2 (movement 2)
    3<=1 return from 1
extra: 6. checkmate and stalemate:
    1=>3 (movement 1)
    2=>2 (movement 2)
    3<=1 return from 1

    if this causes a checkmate in the end put
    --checkmate
    so
    1=>3 (movement 1)
    2=>2 (movement 2)
    3<=1 return from 1
    --checkmate
    and if it is a stalemate(so draw) do --stalemate

extra: 7. I forgot a lot

7.1.

ok there are things I forgot to add.
first of all
there are times where you get a checkmate not because the check can't be stopped. But because if you do stop it, you won't be able to move on the other board.
Normally someone like Shad would say something like
"This is the defenition of checkmate".
But this is my notation so I do not care.

If this happens you put in the end
--stale-checkmate

7.2.

I kind of forgot that en pessant and castling exist
lets deal with castling first

we will use a new notation for castling

+ for white
- for black
>Q for queenside
>K for kingside
the board coordinates(no physical ones here)
|t||l|
so for example
+>K|20||2|

7.3 now lest move on to en passant

this one will be simple

after the P for pawn you put
// or \\.
If the eaten pawn is right to the eating pawn it's //
if vise versa it will be \\.

7.4 softmates

Simple enough.
For cheks you did / in the start and end
For softmates you will just do // in the start and end instead of /.

Also softmates at checkmates (even if you can't time travel back) will be notated as // // and not / /.

7.5 the present
If you want to notate the present line for the time dimension
you do Pr and after it how much after or before it (if it is before you use -)
so
Pr0
Pr-2
Pr3
though if you are gonna use Pr you need to tell in the start the time coordinate of it
so
Pr = 10 (this has to be in the start of the moveset)

7.6 promotion
for the move just put ^ in the start and end.
also if it is a check or softmate you put the ^ inside the slashes.

7.7 notating full games

Before we move onto games. What are movesets.
A moveset is all the moves done in one advancement.

it would be something like this

Pr = 10
1=>3 +N a1|Pr-2||-1| --> a1|Pr-1||1| 
2=>2 +B e5|11||0| -#2-> e6|10||0|
3=>1 return from 1

we are gonna add { in the start and } in the end
so

{
Pr = 10
1=>3 +N a1|Pr-2||-1| --> a1|Pr-1||1| 
2=>2 +B e5|11||0| -#2-> e6|10||0|
3=>1 return from 1   
}

now to represent a game we just do something like this.

1. {
    (moveset 1)
}
2. {
    (moveset 2)
}
3. {
    (moveset 3)
}

and so on until the end of the game.

You might be wondering about how we know if it's black or white.
We already know from two things.
The color of the pieces moving in the moves of the moveset.
And also if the moveset number (so like moveset's 1 moveset number is 1) is odd it's white and if even it's black.
That might be wierd but we kind of do not want to start from moveset 0 because that might be confusing.

If we want to notate just one move we just do
{
(moveset)
}
that's it for the notation I think (If I forgot something I will try add it to the things I forgot in the seventh section).
