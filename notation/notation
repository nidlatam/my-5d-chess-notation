ok what would you need in a notation
1. a way of showing coordinates:
    xy|t||l|
    x is the horizantal
    y is vertical
    t is time. It starts at 1
    l is timeline. The first one is 0. If there is more than one starting it is addressed in line 11.
    # if it blacked out or whited out. If the number is negative it is blacked out and if positive it will be whited out
    if there are two starting boards
    +0 and -0
    so it could be 
    A1|10||#2| would be 
    physical coordinate A1
    the time would be 10
    the timeline would be timeline 2 and it would be whited out 

    also one note
    if there is a new timeline the first board on it will not be 1. That would just make it more confusing.
    If you want to get the coordinate of the first board of a new timeline here is a tip.
    just get the time coordinate of where you are moving to and yeah like that you get it.
    
    I did want to show if the board is white or black but we already know that from the piece that moves.
2. a way of showing the thing that is moving plus the color:
    + or - for white and black
    letters for the pieces 
    P for a pawn
    R for a rook
    B for a bishop
    N for a knight
    K for a king
    Q for a queen
    U for an unicorn
    D for a dragon
    so +D would be white dragon for example
3. a way of showing movement:
    lets use some arrows
    -->
    if it time travels and creates a new dimension
    we put inside the -s the coordinate
    so
    -10->
    and if it blacked or whited out (you can tell with the color of the piece moving)
    -#10->
    ok that's the arrow done

    before the second coordinate
    if there is a piece taken 
    we show that piece with the opposite color
    
    oh and I forgot
    check, checkmate
    I am gonna have check be represented here
    but checkmate and stalemate after all the movements
    in the start if it makes a check do / in the start and end

    now to combine this all lets give an example

    /+D a1|20||0| -#2-> -B a2|19||1|/
4. a way of showing multiple moves:
    1=>1 (movement 1)
    2=>2 (movement 2)
    3=>3 (movement 3)
5. a way of showing moves between timelines that do not cause another timeline
    imagine there are timelines 1, 2 and 3
    (they are ordered from top timeline coordinate to the bottem)
    1=>3 (movement 1)
    2=>2 (movement 2)
    3<=1 return from 1
extra: 6. checkmate and stalemate:
    1=>3 (movement 1)
    2=>2 (movement 2)
    3<=1 return from 1

    if this causes a checkmate in the end put
    --checkmate
    so
    1=>3 (movement 1)
    2=>2 (movement 2)
    3<=1 return from 1
    --checkmate
    and if it is a stalemate(so draw) do --stalemate
